### Description

This is a simple weather app that uses wtrr.in 
API to get the weather of a city. It is built using Python, 
FastAPI, and Docker.

- I used FastAPI because it is a modern, fast (high-performance),
- Also I've used dependency injector framework because it perfectly matches to FastAPI and it is a powerful tool for managing and injecting dependencies in Python.
- Considering that the app is small so i've used monorepo structure to keep the code organized.
- I've used Docker to containerize the app and make it easy to run and deploy.
- Also most of things are simplified and abstracted because of test assignment nature.
  - Config may be injected with DI framework default tools but i've used singleton pattern to keep it simple.
  - Exception handling is simplified and not coverage all cases.
  - Logging is simplified and not cover all cases.
